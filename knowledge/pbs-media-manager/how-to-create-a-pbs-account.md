##  Overview
This page is intended for anyone who needs to create a PBS Account to access PBS Digital tools such as Bento, Media Manager, etc. If you would like instructions on how to create a PBS Account to log in to [PBS.org](http://pbs.org/), please [view the PBS.org help pages](https://help.pbs.org/support/solutions/articles/12000086698-how-do-i-create-a-pbs-account-).
##  What is a PBS account?
PBS Account is a login system that allows you to maintain a single identity across PBS products. When you create a PBS Account, your login and password moves between [each product](https://docs.pbs.org/) to which you've requested access. 
This section shows you how to create a PBS account if you do not currently have one, and how to navigate your account information once you have logged in. 
Stations can request access to PBS Digital Platforms such as MVault, Bento, Media Manager, Curate, etc. by submitting a ticket at [http://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new](http://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new).
##  How to create a PBS account

    * The product URL is the link to the product console. View a list of available consoles on the right side of the [docs.pbs.org homepage](https://docs.pbs.org/) under PBS Digital Consoles.
  * Click Create an account (Figure 1).

##  How to create a strong password
  * Use a pass phrase that is easy for you to remember, but hard for someone to guess.
  * Avoid obvious patterns such as qwerty, abcdef, ggghhh, 123321.
  * Avoid stand-alone words, in any language, including slang or jargon, followed by a digit and\or symbol. Example: Password1$.
  * Avoid using your name, or the names of family members or pets, SSN, phone numbers, etc. 
  * Avoid writing down your password, or storing your password on any system without encryption.
  * Avoid sharing your password with anyone.
  * Do not use the same password for work and personal accounts. 
  * Your password must be treated as confidential information.


A password might meet all the criteria above and still be a weak password. For example, Hello2U! meets all the criteria for a strong password listed above, but is still weak because it contains a complete word. H3ll0 2 U! is a stronger alternative because it replaces some of the letters in the complete word with numbers and also includes spaces.
Tips for remembering your password:
  * Create an acronym from an easy-to-remember piece of information.
  * Substitute numbers and symbols for letters and words in an easy-to-remember phrase. Example: Pick a phrase that is meaningful to you, such as I love winter. Using that phrase as your guide, you might use 1l0v3w1nT3r for your password.


![:warning:](https://pf-emoji-service--cdn.us-east-1.prod.public.atl-paas.net/atlassian/warning_64.png)
If you feel you must write down your password in order to remember it, make sure you don't label it as your password, and keep it in a safe place.
