##  Overview
The History feature in Media Manager allows you to view a history log of changes that have occurred at every level in the console. To see changes made to a specific object, you must click into the object. For instance, if you want to make changes to a collection, you cannot simply click the Collections tab at the Show level. You must click the Collections tab, click into a Collection and then click the History button.
##  Available changes
You can see a list of modifications including, what has been changed, who made the change, and when it was changed.

##  How to view history
When you are on any page in the console, click the yellow History button located in the upper right side of the screen (Figure 1).

  * The list of objects that have been modified in some way appear in a list by date with most recently modified at the top (Figure 2.1).
  * Click the Display dropdown menu to display fewer or more objects per page (Figure 2.2).
  * Use the filters on the right side of the page to narrow the list of objects (Figure 2.3). [Learn how to user filters](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5345074/History+Logging#How-to-use-filters)

##  How to use filters
Filters allow you to narrow the list of objects in the history log. As soon as you make a selection in a dropdown menu, the results adjust to reflect the filter you have chosen. You can filter by:
  * Display History - Specific windows of time that you want to view the history. You can also view the full history. 
  * Action - The action that was done to an object. Was it created, updated, or deleted?
  * Method - The method by which the object was modified. Was it done through the Media Manager console, API, or the system?
  * User - The user who made the modification.
