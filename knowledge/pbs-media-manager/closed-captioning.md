##  What is closed captioning?
Closed captioning is the visual display of the audio portion of video programming. Captioning provides access to individuals who are deaf or have hearing loss and is often used in places where it is difficult to hear a TV program, such as restaurants and exercise facilities. FCC rules require captioned programs shown on TV to be captioned when re-shown on the Internet.
[Learn how to add multiple caption files to your asset](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343793/Assets#multiplecaptions)
##  Managing closed captioning settings for PBS applications
  * Captions can be toggled on/off and customized for all PBS apps and sites within the individual players or application settings. 
  * For videos with multiple language captions, all language options display in the closed captions menu. 
  * Closed captioning on PBS videos is turned OFF by default.

  * On PBS apps and OTT platforms, please refer to the device user settings area to manage closed captioning preferences.


##  When to include a closed captioning file
For the FULL details and FCC rules and deadlines, please visit: [https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/captioning-internet-video-programming](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/captioning-internet-video-programming)
You ARE REQUIRED to include a caption file if: | 
  * You are uploading a Full Episode (unless one of the FCC exemptions noted farther below is applicable).
  * You are uploading a Prerecorded, Unedited Program. It must be captioned if televised anywhere in U.S. on or after September 30, 2012.
  * You are uploading a Substantially Edited Program. It must be captioned if televised anywhere in U.S. on or after September 30, 2013. Example of substantial edits is deleting entire scenes.
  * You are uploading a Live / Near-Live Program. It must be captioned if televised in U.S. on or after March 30, 2013. Live programs are distributed substantially simultaneously with their creation, whereas Near-Live programs are recorded less than 24 hours prior to their first distribution.
  * You are uploading a Straight Lift or Montage Clip.
    * Straight lift clips are defined as clips that “contain a single excerpt of a captioned television program with the same video and audio that was presented on television.” 
    * Montage clips combine together different parts of a program. The caption requirement rules for montage clips went into effect in 2017.
  * You have a preview which contains content that was televised at least 15 days prior.
    * While a preview doesn’t have to be captioned when it is functioning as an actual preview (i.e., before the program has been televised) because it is digital-only content at that point, the FCC rules specifically require digital-only content to receive captions within 15 days of the content being televised.
  * The primary audio track language for your video is English or Spanish. In this case, you must provide a caption file in the same language.
    * This includes operas performed in English or Spanish.

  
---|---  
You are not required (but are encouraged) to include a caption file if: | 
  * It is digital-only, non-televised content.
    * Note: If the content is later televised with captions, then the caption file needs to be made available online within 15 days (or the content needs to be taken offline).
  * This content was televised without captions because it is subject to a self-implementing FCC Exemption. (See details on the [FCC site](https://www.fcc.gov/general/self-implementing-exemptions-closed-captioning-rules) and [NAD](https://www.nad.org/resources/technology/television-and-closed-captioning/exemptions-from-the-closed-captioning-rule/).)
  * It is archival content, never televised in the U.S. on or after Sept. 29, 2012.
  * The video is for internal use only, and cannot be accessed by the general public.
  * The video's primary audio track language is not English nor Spanish.
  * There are no spoken words during the video.

Warning: Caption file being unavailable is not an acceptable justification. In such cases, do not upload the content until the caption file is available. If a closed caption file is required but you have valid, FCC-recognized exemption, you must provide a [justification](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5344210/Closed+Captioning#Adding-a-justification) in Media Manager.   
##  Which closed captioning style to use
Pop-on captions are generally used for pre-recorded and online video, and are the FCC's preferred style for this type of content as it pertains to compliance.This is because pop-on captions allow for proper/exact placement and timing, to better illustrate what is being said and by whom. (Captions cannot block other important visual content on the screen, overlap one another or run off the edge of the video screen.)
Roll-up captions are usually reserved only for live performances or live news. Media Manager does support the roll-up caption style, but pop-on captions are strongly preferred by the FCC for all pre-recorded and online video.
##  FCC closed captioning rules and deadlines
Interstitials and promotional announcements continue to be exempt from captioning on broadcast television, so they do not need to be captioned online as long as they are not captioned when broadcast. However, providing caption files to make the content more accessible is highly recommended. Also, this rule could be changed by the FCC in the future.
##### See entire deadline schedule
###  Deadlines
Date | Task  
---|---  
Date | Task  
---|---  
September 30, 2012 | All prerecorded programming that is not substantially edited for Internet distribution must be captioned when distributed via IP if it is shown on television with captions on or after this date.  
March 30, 2013 | All live or near-live programming must be captioned when distributed via IP if it is shown on television with captions on or after this date. Live programming is defined as “video programming that is shown on television substantially simultaneously with its performance” and near-live programming is defined as “video programming that is performed and recorded less than 24 hours prior to the time it was first aired on television.”  
September 30, 2013 | All prerecorded programming that is substantially edited for Internet distribution must be captioned when distributed via IP if it is shown on television with captions on or after this date. Examples of substantial edits provided by the FCC include “the deletion of scenes or alterations to the televised version of musical scores.”  
January 1, 2014 | Caption control deadline. All IP-delivered content.  
March 30, 2014 | The above deadlines do not apply to uncaptioned, archival IP-delivered programs. Archival programs do not need to be captioned online unless they are re-run on television on or after Mar. 30, 2014, in which case there is a 45-day window to go back and add captions to the online version. This window shortens to 30 days as of Mar. 30, 2015 and to 15 days as of Mar. 30, 2016.  
March 16, 2015 | Caption Quality Standards  
January 1, 2016 | Captioning for “straight lift” clips. Straight lift clips are defined as a single excerpt of a program that had been captioned when first shown on TV with the same video and audio as had been broadcast.  
January 1, 2017 | Captioning for video montages. Video montages are collections of clips from different broadcasts that all had been captioned when broadcast.  
July 1, 2017 | Captioning for clips of time-sensitive (live or near-live) programming. “Live” and “near-live” programming have the same meanings as in the original IP captioning rules. There will be a 12 hour grace period between TV airing and required online captioning for live programming and an eight hour grace period for near-live programming.  
* * *
###  Captioning quality is measured in the following ways:
Accuracy | 
  * Preserve and display spoken words or song lyrics in their original language in the proper order.
  * Proper names and places cannot be replaced or paraphrased, except when necessary to resolve time constraints.
  * Proper spelling and use of homophones, punctuation, capitalization, tense, singular/plural forms, and number representation (symbols vs. words).
  * Intentional slang or grammatical errors should be preserved.
  * As much as possible, provide non-observable information, including speaker identity, music, sound effects, and audience reaction.
  * Ensure caption text is legible and displayed with spacing optimized for readability.

  
---|---  
Synchronicity | 
  * Caption text display must be synchronized with the audio to the greatest extent possible.
  * Caption display speed must be optimized for readability.

  
Completeness | 
  * Captions must be provided for the entirety of the program, to the greatest extent possible.

  
Placement | 
  * Caption text must not cover critical visual content. Examples include: character faces, sub-titles, credits, news updates, banners, lower thirds, CGs, on-screen graphics, etc.
  * Caption text must not be cut off or positioned to overlap lines.
  * Optimize caption font size for readability.

  
##  What this means for you
  * Maintain quality. Stations are responsible for adhering to the new requirements, and provide captions of "at least the same quality" as those used for broadcast programming. 
  * Don't obscure your content. With regard to placement, caption text must not cover critical visual content, such as faces, sub-titles, banners, lower thirds, CGs, on-screen graphics, etc. In these cases, the source caption file must be formatted to display the corresponding segments on a different part of the screen, prior to being uploaded to Media Manager.
  * Mind your position. By default, the caption display position is bottom, center. If critical video content is not covered when captions are displayed at the default position, then no placement information is necessary within the caption file.
  * Don't sweat the small stuff. The FCC will not hold owners or distributors responsible for quality issues outside of their control, such as broadband connection speeds or the constraints of a particular apparatus.


Please note: Media Manager will not validate for caption quality compliance. The system will only preserve caption placement formatting information, if provided, in the stations' source files. Media Manager will continue to support all caption file formats, except SRT, which does not handle placement settings.
##  Acceptable caption file formats
These are the caption file formats supported for uploading in Media Manager.
Supported | 
  * DFXP (.dfxp)
    * DFXP stands for “Distribution Format Exchange Profile.” It is a timed-text format that was developed by W3C and it is commonly known by the extension (.dfxp).
  * SCC (.scc)
    * SCC stands for "Scenarist Closed Captions". It is commonly used with broadcast and streaming/web video, as well as DVDs and VHS videos.
    * Language support is limited to: English, Spanish, French, German, and a cross section of other Western European languages. Korean and Japanese may also be supported.
  * SMPTE-TT (.xml, .ttml)
    * XML stands for “Extensible Markup Language”, and can come in many formats, the most common being DFXP, SMPTE-TT and TTML.
    * SMPTE-TT stands for the “Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineering – Timed Text.” It is a type of XML file developed by SMPTE and It is commonly known by the extension (.xml).
    * TTML stands for “Timed Text Markup Language” and is an Authoring, Interchange and Distribution format. It is an advanced and complex caption format, used mainly by the broadcast industry and online applications. TTML files have the file extension (.ttml)

  
---|---  
Not Supported | 
  * SAMI (lacks support for the specifications required for the FCC's caption compliance rules)
  * SRT (lacks support for the specifications required for the FCC's caption compliance rules)
  * WebVTT

##  Adding a justification
If you find that closed captioning is not required for your video, follow the instructions below to add a justification. A justification tells Media Manager that you are legally exempt from providing a closed captioning file with your video and continue with the ingestion process.
##  How to add closed captioning files

  * After you've added your video file, the caption section detects the video's Primary Language and populates the language textbox with the same language (Figure 2.1).
  * You have two options of adding your caption file:
    * Type the full URL of your closed captioning file (Figure 2.2).
    * Choose a caption file from your computer (Figure 2.3).
  * If you are not including a closed captioning file, click the checkbox next to Or, provide valid caption justification and select a reason from the options provided why you do not need to ingest a caption file (Figure 2.4).

  * If choosing not to add a caption file, click the radio button next to the option that most closely represents the reason you are not including a caption file (Figure 3).
    * If none of the options clearly define why, click the radio button next to Other and in the textbox provided, type the justification.

  * After adding your caption file (Figure 4.1), click Save (Figure 4.2).
    * If you want to auto-publish your asset, click the checkbox next to Auto Publish (Figure 4.3). 


##### Learn about Auto Publish
####  What is auto-publish?
The auto-publish feature ensures that once all necessary files have been successfully ingested, your asset will automatically publish. This means that you can upload your video file (and caption file if applicable) and walk away during the ingestion process to do other things. You must check back in on the process in case any errors occur during ingestion. If errors occur, the process will stop and your asset will not publish until the errors are corrected.
####  What if I leave and my asset encounters an error?
It's very important to remember that when you are using the auto-publish feature, you mustbe diligent about checking the ingestion status. If ingestion fails, an error message appears in the console and your asset does not publish. You need to manually fix the errors and republish the asset by clicking the Publish button. Refer to the publish status to see if everything successfully ingested and published.

##  How users view closed captioning
  * The closed captioning icon appears at the bottom right side of the video. Clicking this icon turns closed captioning on and off. 
  * After closed captioning has been enabled, the captions display in the bottom part of the video.
    * Users can [customize the appearance of the captions](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5344210/Closed+Captioning#How-users-format-closed-captioning) on their screen by clicking Customize, located in the closed captioning menu that displays after clicking the CC icon.

##  How users format closed captioning
When a user activates closed captioning on your video, they have the option to format the caption text color, style, and much more. This section shows you the options available to users when they activate closed captioning on your videos.
  * A box opens with multiple formatting options including:
    * Font size (1)
    * Font family (2)
    * Edge style (3)
    * Font color (4)
    * Background color (5)
    * Window color (6)
    * Text opacity (7)
    * Background opacity (8)
    * Window opacity (9)
  * Drag the sliders, click the dropdown menus , or click a color block to adjust the appearance. A real time preview at the top of the popup box displays each adjustment (10).
  * When finished formatting, click Save Settings to save the changes (11). * Each time Save Settings is clicked, the video starts back at the beginning.
  * You can format the captions as many different times and ways as you like. They will remain changed until you clear the cookies on your computer or click Reset (12).
  * If you have changed your mind and do not want to change the settings, simply click the X in the upper right side of the popup box (13).

##  Troubleshooting
If you notice caption display issues within the video player, and/or Media Manager ingestion errors during the file upload, please refer to this troubleshooting guide. 
####  Captions Not Displaying in Video Player
If you’ve uploaded and ingested a caption file in Media Manager but are not seeing the caption text displayed in the video player when the closed captioning option is enabled, verify that the start timing in your caption file is correct:
  1. In the Media Manager console, navigate to the "Video" tab for the asset.
  2. Expand the Closed Captioning details area by clicking on the “i” (Info) icon.
  3. In the Output Files area, click on the link for the output WebVTT file and open it in a new browser tab. 
  4. Look at the start time for the very first caption cue and see if it aligns with the beginning of the dialogue/audio in the video.
  5. If the timing is not accurate, make the necessary adjustments to your source file and re-upload it.


####  Ingestion Failures When Uploading in Media Manager
In Media Manager, caption errors are designated by the following label: ![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5344210/ingestion-failed.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1580496646247&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
To view the specific caption error messaging, hover your mouse over the ![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5344210/closed-captioning-exclamation.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1580918445096&cacheVersion=1&api=v2) icon(s) in the output files section. The error message appears as a popup. The output files section is located in the Closed Captioning section, under the Details section.
###  Overview
If your video file displays a Failed message (1), there's the possibility your video didn't actually fail, rather, the caption ingestion failed (2), making it impossible to create a synced playlist.
####  How to fix it
Click Output Files to check the caption file errors (3). Fix the errors and reingest the caption file. Once the caption file is reingested, the error will go away and your video file will successfully upload.
![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5344210/closed-captioning-file-failure.jpg?version=3&modificationDate=1671463729855&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
###  Closed captioning timing markers are synced to broadcast video file instead of streaming video file
Broadcast video time code typically starts at one hour (01:00:00;00) because of the pre-roll needed for broadcast engineers (color bars, etc.). Streaming video files do not retain time code from the broadcast file and thus begin at zero (00:00:00;00). The time code on your closed captioning file must be adjusted to match your streaming file. 
####  How to fix it
  * When you see the Ingestion Failed message, click Output Files to expand the list and view the error messaging.
  * Hover your mouse over the 
![:exclamat:](https://pbs-docs.atlassian.net/gateway/api/emoji/b11f3abe-affc-4531-a760-d1d7c5eaa315/3e118585-4c3d-469d-a3a3-3d84da2fb67e/path)
to view the error message.
  * The error message displays the time at which the first caption begins, if it is past the hour mark (01:00:00;00). 
  * In your caption software tool, sync the first caption to the streaming video file (.mp4) and choose to roll all captions by the same time offset. This should be a feature in your caption editing tool. 
  * Verify that all captions now start from the zero hour (00:00:00;00) and reingest the caption file.

###  Not enough time left between segments
Each caption time entry must be long enough to display the lines of text. If a segment is too short, the system is unable to read the text in the allotted time and an error is produced.
####  How to fix it
  * When you see the Ingestion Failed message, click Output Files to expand the list and view the error messaging
  * Hover your mouse over the 
![:exclamat:](https://pbs-docs.atlassian.net/gateway/api/emoji/b11f3abe-affc-4531-a760-d1d7c5eaa315/3e118585-4c3d-469d-a3a3-3d84da2fb67e/path)
to view the error message.
  * A line in the caption file displays in too short a period of time. In the example below, 
  * Open your caption file and add more time in between captions or break the caption into two separate lines. 
  * Reingest the caption file.


The error messaging only displays the first error of this kind so please check your file for other instances.
