##  Overview
All content that is added to the Media Manager console can be searched using the search feature located directly in the console. Similarly, users of PBS.org and PBS apps can search for content using the search feature available in each platform. All search features on PBS products disregard accents, special characters, and diacritics, so even if users include those elements in a keyword search, results are based solely on the alphabetical characters in the search criteria. 
##  How to search
This section demonstrates how to search for content in the Media Manager console.
  * From the left navigation menu, click Search (Figure 1.1).
  * In the search textbox, type text that is included in the content for which you are searching (Figure 1.2). You must include search criteria, otherwise the search will not work.
  * Click the dropdown menu and click the type of content you want to search (Figure 1.3).
  * Click Search (Figure 1.4).

  * Your search results display (Figure 2).
  * The text from your keyword search in Figure 1.2 displays in the Title column* (Figure 2.1). Click the title of the object you want to view.
  * The type of object you searched displays in the Object Type column (Figure 2.2).

* Results for Season display in a different format

##  Search tips
The following outlines the search criteria required to search by each field. Keep in mind that some fields, such as Franchise, are limited to the content to which you have access so some results may not display.

##  PBS.org and Apps search
  * When users of PBS.org and PBS apps search by keyword using the search feature (Figure 1.1), they can include accents, special characters, and diacritics (Figure 1.2).


Figure 1
![search-new0.jpg](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5346345/search-new0.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1746821474284&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
  * The Search feature ignores all special characters and returns results based solely on the alphabetical characters (Figure 2).


Figure 2
![search-new.jpg](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5346345/search-new.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1746821528305&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
##  Viewable assets
Quickly scan all assets that are publicly available by referencing the Viewable column in your search results.
  * In the left side navigation menu, click Search (Figure 1.1).
  * In the search textbox, type search criteria, be sure the type of content you are searching is Video Assets, and click Search (Figure 1.2).
  * All matching assets display. In the Viewable column, assets that can be viewed publicly display a green checkmark, while unavailable assets display a red X (Figure 1.3).

##  Search Filters
Search filters are a way to easily find specific content in your Media Manager instance. This feature allows content owners to better analyze, audit, and maintain video content, by applying specific filtering criteria. You can use a single filter or use all available filters when filtering content. 
This feature is currently available for video assets only.
###  Filter types
Filter | Description | Variables  
---|---|---  
Filter | Description | Variables  
---|---|---  
By Show | Returns all assets belonging to a specific show | Show name  
Content Type | Returns all assets by content type | 
  * Full length
  * Clip
  * Preview

  
Is Available | Returns all assets that are available or not available. Assets only need to meet [one level of availability](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5344827/Audience+and+Availability+Rules#Asset-Availability) to display as available. | 
  * True (Available)
  * False (Not available)

  
Is Published | Returns all published assets or all assets that are not published. | 
  * True (Published)
  * False (Not published)

  
Search In | Returns all assets that include specific keyword(s) in the title or title and description. | Text  
###  How to access filters
  * To access the filter feature, click Search located in the left side navigation menu (Figure 1.1).
  * Currently, filtering is only available on video assets and that displays by default (Figure 1.2).
  * The Add Filter feature is located on the right side of the Search button (Figure 1.3). 


The Add Filter button only displays for video assets.

###  How to use keywords to filter
While you do not need to use keywords to filter assets, keywords do narrow down your search results. This section shows how to search by keywords and filter the results. 
The following example demonstrates how to filter by show name. 
  * In the search textbox, type a keyword or keywords that you want to search (Figure 1.1). This Search looks for keyword matches in a video asset title.
  * Click Search (Figure 1.2).
  * All results containing the keywords in the asset title display (Figure 1.3).

![filter-assets1.jpg](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5346345/filter-assets1.jpg?version=2&modificationDate=1755098730849&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
  * Click Add Filter (Figure 2.1).
  * Click the Rule dropdown menu to display all filters and click the By Show filter (Figure 2.2).


In this example we are filtering by show.
