##  Multiple Audio Tracks
###  Media Manager Input Specs for Multiple Audio Tracks
A video with multiple audio tracks means that in addition to the primary audio, additional tracks for Audio Description (AD), and/or one or more secondary languages are included. In this scenario, users can toggle between the different audio tracks in most PBS video players. See the table below for PBS player support.
  * The multiple audio track support info below pertains only to VOD (video on demand) on PBS platforms – not livestream channels.
  * For livestream channels:
    * PBS Platforms do not currently support multiple audio tracks for the GA or KIDS 24/7 livestreams.
    * PBS passes all provided audio tracks via sIX to external partners, but we cannot speak to each partner's support for multiple audio tracks on their platforms.


  * Media Manager Input: All audio tracks must be included with the single, video source file uploaded in Media Manager. 
    * Sidecar/Standalone audio track files are not supported. 
    * Some resource information for generating files meeting the required specifications is included below.
  * Channels: For each audio track, Media Manager supports two channels (stereo).
    * 5.1 Surround is not supported in Media Manager.
  * Number of Tracks: Unlimited
  * Track Order:
    * Track 1: Reserved for Primary audio
    * Track 2: Reserved for Audio Description, if it exists with the same language assignment as the Primary track. Otherwise, an additional language track
    * Subsequent Tracks: There is no limit to the number of secondary language (or secondary language Audio Description) tracks.
  * Language rules: We accept the three-character [ISO 639.2 language codes](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) when supplied in the file’s audio description, and set that as the language for the track/s. If the three-character code is not present for language in the description:
    * The first track will be defined by default as Primary
    * Subsequent tracks will be defined by default as Secondary_01, Secondary_02, Secondary_03, etc.

###  Resources for Generating Video Files Containing Multiple Audio Tracks
  * Possible Tool Suggestions:
    * License Required: The PBS MOC uses Telestream Vantage to create files for Digital as well as the DVI/SAP test files.
    * License Required: AWS MediaConvert should be capable of generating a file meeting the required specs, but has not been tested or confirmed.
    * Free or Open Source: FFmpeg should be capable of generating a file meeting the required specs, but has not been tested or confirmed.
  * Workflows:
    * If your standard workflow for generating video files already involves working with the PBS MOC, they should be able to help determine if it can be adapted to accommodate multiple audio tracks.
    * If your workflow does not already involve the PBS MOC, you will need to develop your own process for generating video source files which meet the required specs for multiple audio. 
    * Unfortunately, there is not a one-size-fits-all workflow, given the various video editing tool and configuration options.


##  Multi-channel Surround (5.1, 7.1)
Multi-channel surround (5.1, 7.1) is not supported in Media Manager, due to downstream client limitations. 
Media Manager will accept and successfully ingest a video file with a single 5.1 (6-channel) or 7.1 (8-channel) audio track, but it will be automatically downmixed to stereo (2-channel) by our transcoding service, AWS MediaConvert. 
The stereo downmix settings used by MediaConvert are different than those used by the PBS MOC (Media Operations Center). Both setting configurations are included below. If your video source file has a single 5.1 or 7.1 audio track, and you would like it to match how content gets mixed down by the MOC, it is recommended that you handle it on your end before uploading the file in Media Manager.
PBS MOC 5.1-to-Stereo Downmix Settings:  
Left: L, -60 R, -3 C, -60 LFE, -3 Ls, -60 Rs  
Right: -60 L, R, -3 C, -60 LFE, -60 Ls, -3 Rs
AWS MediaConvert 7.1-to-Stereo Downmix Settings:  
Left: -6 L, -60 R, -4 C, -20 LFE, -14 Ls, -60 Rs, -14 Lrs, -16 Rrs  
Right: -60 L, -6 R, -4 C, -20 LFE, -60 Ls, -14 Rs, -60 Lrs, -14 Rrs
#  Output Specs
##  Output Video Formats
  1. HLS 16x9 1080p (only provided if input source file is 1080p; we don't up-convert)
  2. HLS 16x9 720p
  3. MP4 16x9 Baseline
  4. MP4 16x9 720p


##  Output Video Encodings
We use AWS MediaConvert's Automated Adaptive Bitrate (AABR) and Quality-Defined Variable Bitrate (QVBR) encoding features for all video files uploaded in Media Manager. These features allow us to automate the creation of video resolutions and bitrates based on video complexity, and to deliver them much more efficiently to PBS client players. We also use Common Media Application Format (CMAF) as the container format used to package and deliver http-based, segmented video files.
  * AABR automatically chooses the right number of renditions (and the resolution for each one), based on the input video. Therefore, the number of renditions/resolutions generated will vary based on the video content.
  * QVBRworks in tandem with AABR, and determines (through analysis during upload) the optimal bitrates generated for each rendition/resolution. Therefore, the bitrates generated will vary based on the video content.
  * CMAFsimplifies the delivery of media to playback devices by working with both the HLS and DASH protocols to package data under a uniform transport container file. It also employs chunked encoding and chunked transfer encoding to lower latency. This can result in lower costs, due to reduced storage needs and reduced quality due to video latency. CMAF is a standard format used for HLS and DASH file delivery, and is an enabling technology which will allow us to make additional encoding-related improvements in the future.

#  Alternate/Enhanced Accessibility Videos
Some videos may offer an alternate or enhanced accessibility feature, such as:
  1. American Sign Language (ASL): A visual language, where information is conveyed using shape, placement, and movement of the hands, as well as facial expressions and body movements.
  2. Extended Audio Description (EAD): With standard Audio Description (AD), descriptions fit within the existing, natural pauses in the video. With Extended Audio Description, longer pauses are added within the video, to provide opportunities for lengthier descriptions and more context. EAD videos are longer in duration.
  3. Open Captions (OC): Captions which are burned into the video file and are always displayed during playback. Open Captions cannot be customized or turned off by the user.


[See more information about relating multiple accessibility versions of the same video in Media Manager](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343793/Assets#Alternate-Accessibility-Versions).
