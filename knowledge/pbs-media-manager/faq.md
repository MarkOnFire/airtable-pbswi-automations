##  General
##### I need to edit a field but do not have permission.
Please [submit a support ticket](http://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new) and request the change. You will either be given permission to make the edit or PBS will do it for you. 
* * *
##### Can I rearrange or reorder my content?
Yes. Many objects can be recategorized or reordered. [Learn how](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343842/How+to+Rearrange+or+Reassign+Content)
* * *
##### What is an easy way to keep track of where I am in the console?
Using the breadcrumbs at the top of each page is the easiest way to not only keep track of where you are in the console, but to return to previous pages without having to back out to the main console home page. The breadcrumbs especially come in handy when [creating Collections](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343803/Collections#How-to-create-a-collection) and adding episodes to your collection since you are operating within the same show.

* * *
##### When I publish an asset, why are there random characters in the URL?
There are a few reasons for this:
  1. Random characters in the video slug allow for more than one video with the same title. For example, without random characters there could only be one instance of “episode 1.”
  2. Random characters can take the place of a show name. This is important for use cases such as the following:
    1. a video asset has the following slug: nova-episode-2-wogskg
    2. you realize that asset actually belongs to the show “nature”
    3. you can move the asset, but the slug/URL would always have the reference to “nova”
  3. A very long show and video title can make for a very unfriendly URL. Random characters decrease the length of a URL.

##  Remote Assets
##### What is a Remote Asset?
Remote Assets are web objects that can surface external content such as webpages or static images on your website and are referred to as Related Content in your video asset. Remote Assets are a great way to provide depth to your content by providing viewers with additional related subject matter.
Remote Assets can render on a video asset page in two ways:
  * Episode Link - Title and URL
  * Learn More Promo - Title, URL, description, and image.


Creating a remote asset and associating it with a video asset is done in two separate places in the Media Manager console. Remote assets are created in the [Remote Assets section](https://media.console.pbs.org/admin/remote-assets/) which can be accessed from the Remote Assets link in the left side navigation menu. Remote Assets are associated with a video asset from the actual video asset.
