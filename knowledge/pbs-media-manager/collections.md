##  Overview

##  Demo
[ demo-collections mp42 MB ](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343803/Collections)
A Collection consists of [episodes](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343798) and [specials](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343806) belonging to a single show. They are their own section like [Extras](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5344064/Extras), More Episodes, Clips and Previews and episodes are added to a Collection not from the Collection page but from the [Episode page](https://docs.pbs.org/x/UgFI). 
As an example, [Junk in the Trunk](https://www.pbs.org/search/?q=junk+in+the+trunk) is a collection of episodes belonging to [Antiques Roadshow](https://www.pbs.org/show/antiques-roadshow/). 
Important notes:
  * All content added to a Collection must be part of the same show. 
  * Only full length assets are allowed (no clips or previews). 
  * A show is not required to have Collections.
  * You can add an unlimited number of videos to a Collection, but currently only 12 display on the front-end. This limit will be expanded in early 2025. 


##  Where Collections display on [PBS.org](http://pbs.org/)
Collections display as a menu item on a show page.
![collections-where.jpg](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343803/collections-where.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1737048593358&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
##  How Collections are organized
If a Collection contains Episodes and Specials, Episodes are shown first, followed by Specials. Episodes display in chronological order starting at Season 1, Episode 1, if applicable. Specials are sorted by encore date (the encore date of the special’s container, not the Full Length Video asset encore date, if it’s different) in descending order, with the most recent special listed last.
##  How to create a Collection
This section shows you how to create a new Collection and how to add Episodes to your Collection.
Field | Notes | Required for create?  
---|---|---  
Field | Notes | Required for create?  
---|---|---  
Title | Title of the Collection. 256 characters or less, including spaces. | Yes  
Slug | Auto-generated unique identifier that cannot be changed after initial save. | Yes (automatically generated from Title, and is editable only prior to initial save)  
Short Description | 100 characters or less, including spaces. Used primarily when space is limited, such as on apps and small screens. | Yes  
Long Description | 400 characters or less, including spaces. | Yes  
Sortable Title | Auto-generated unique identifier. | Yes (prefilled from title; is editable)  
PBS Content ID | Auto-generated unique identifier. | Yes (automatically generated; not editable)  
Featured | On/Off. Displays the collection more prominently than a standard Collection on the site. | Yes (Default=Off)  
Created | The date and time the Collection is created. | N/A  
Updated | The date and time the Collection was last updated. | N/A  
###  How to add notes
The Notes feature provides a place for editors to store internal notes and collaborate with colleagues. Notes is an optional feature intended as a convenience for console users and is not included in the API or displayed on frontend platforms. The text limit is 2,000 characters, including spaces, and can contain text only (hyperlinks can be added but they will not be clickable).
To use the Notes feature, simply click Notes at the top of the page and begin typing. The Notes bar displays in yellow when content has been added. If no notes are present, the bar displays in grey. When finished, click Save Notes to save your changes or Delete Notes to clear the entire field. The Notes feature contains its own save buttons that are separate of the object’s save buttons. So if you save the page but you don’t save the Notes section, your notes are not saved. 
Notes are read-only for the [viewer role](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343868/Roles+and+Permissions).

###  Create your collection
  * Click the Shows link from the left navigation menu, click the title of the show to which you want to add a Collection and click the Collections tab (Figure 1).

![how-to-create-a-collection1.jpg](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343803/how-to-create-a-collection1.jpg?version=2&modificationDate=1730222295642&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
  * Click Create Collection (Figure 2).


Figure 2
![how-to-create-a-collection2.jpg](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343803/how-to-create-a-collection2.jpg?version=2&modificationDate=1730222347094&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
  * In the Title textbox, type a title for your Collection. Maximum characters: 60, including spaces (Figure 3.1). 
    * The slug auto-populates as you type the title.
  * In the Short Description textbox, type a short description that provides a summary about your Collection topic. Maximum characters: 100, including spaces (Figure 3.2).
  * In the Long Description textbox, type a long description, providing a little more information about your Collection. Maximum characters: 400, including spaces (Figure 3.3).
  * When finished, click Save (Figure 3.4).


If you receive an error message (500) when saving your file, check the Title field to be sure your character count has not surpassed 60 characters. If you have copied and pasted your title from another source such as Microsoft Word, some special characters, such as apostrophes, quotes, and commas may count as multiple character spaces and put your title over 60 characters. Try manually typing your title into the Title textbox.

If you have moved the collection in error, click the Collection title to move it back to the box on the left, deselecting it.
