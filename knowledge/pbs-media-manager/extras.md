##  Overview
An Extra is a type of [Asset](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343793) that can be associated with a [Franchise](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343789), [Show](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343796), or [Season](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343800). Extras can be Clips or Previews only (no [Full Length Episodes](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343793/Assets)) and have no associated advertisements. These assets appear on a Show page on PBS.org and can be found by scrolling down a Show page to the Extras section.
##  Where Extras display on PBS.org
Extras display in the Clips & Previews section in the menu on a show. They display in the following order: 
  * Extras attached to Episodes, in Season/Episode order
  * Episodes attached to Seasons, appearing after Episode Extras in their respective Season, in encore date order
  * Extras attached to the Show, in encore date order
  * Extras attached to Specials, in encore date order


Additional clips and previews display at the bottom of a season dropdown menu, as shown in Figure 1.
  * Under the Clips & Previews menu item (Figure 1.1), the user should click the Season dropdown menu (Figure 1.2).
  * At the bottom of the menu list, they should click More Clips & Previews to view additional items (Figure 1.3).

Clips always display before previews.
