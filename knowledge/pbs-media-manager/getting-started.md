For quick tutorials on common tasks, please [see our FAQ page](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343949).
##  Overview
To begin working in Media Manager, you must first gain access to the Media Manager console. The console is the tool that is used to add all content including videos, closed caption files, and metadata for all of your seasons, episodes, and assets. 
##  How to Access the Console
To gain access to the console, please [submit a support ticket](http://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new)and let us know that you'd like access to the Media Manager console ([ see a sample support ticket ](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343823/Getting+Started "see a sample support ticket")). After submitting your ticket, you will receive either an email with an activation link or an email informing you of your new access permissions ([ see a sample email ](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343823/Getting+Started "see a sample email")).
If you are not automatically directed to the console, go to [https://media.console.pbs.org](https://media.console.pbs.org/) and log in with your PBS Account. After logging in you'll be directed to the [Shows](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343796) page where you can begin working. 
If you do not have a PBS Account, [click here to learn how to create one](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343932/How+to+Create+a+PBS+Account).
##  Navigating the console
Once you've gained access to the console, learn about some common features.
###  Home screen
  * Your login information displays in the upper right corner of the page.
  * The Notifications area to the left of your login provides information about updates, features, and announcements.
  * When first logging in to the console, all of the[shows](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343796/Shows) you have access to appear in the main body of the page. If you do not have the proper access, please [submit a support ticket](http://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new) and let us know what you need.
  * Use the navigation on the left side of the page to access your franchises, shows, remote assets, a search feature, and a help section containing [forums](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5344723/Media+Manager+API+Forum), [support](http://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new), and [FAQs](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343949/FAQ).
  * Use the breadcrumbs at the top of the page to keep track of where you are in the console.
  * The category that you are currently viewing appears directly below the breadcrumbs and reflects the category highlighted in the left navigation menu.
  * Click the Display dropdown menu to select how many items you want to see displayed per page.
  * Click the Favorites toggle to filter and view only the shows you have designated as Favorites. 
  * Type keywords in the search textbox to search for an item in the current category being viewed (Example: When viewing Shows you can search for shows only, such as American Masters).

###  Show screen
  * Click the Favorite icon to designate a Show as a Favorite

    * Date - Date of the change
    * User - The person who made the change
    * Method - How the change was made 
    * Action - The type of change that was made
    * Object type - The element that was changed

##  Selecting a time zone
Selecting a time zone makes it easier to figure out availability when programming your [shows](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343796/Shows#Availability) and [assets](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343793/Assets#Availability) because the current time in your local area will display. The default is auto-detect, which is based on your IP address. If your location cannot be determined, [UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html) is used. Follow the steps below to select a time zone when working in Media Manager.
  * When you are logged in to [https://media.console.pbs.org/](https://media.console.pbs.org/), click your login in the upper right side of the screen and click Profile Settings (Figure 1).

  * Click the Time Zone dropdown menu and click the time zone you want to associate with your profile (Figure 2). 


* Auto-Detect is selected by default and means the console detects and uses your current time zone.

Your profile settings have been saved (Figure 4). Use the links in the left navigation menu to resume working in the console or click the
