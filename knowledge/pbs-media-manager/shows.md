##  Overview
A show is a container that can hold [Seasons](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343800), [Specials](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343806), [Collections](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343803), and [Extras](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5344064). Shows that you have access to can be viewed from the Shows section of the console. If you maintain several shows, consider "favoriting" them for faster access. [Learn more about favoriting shows](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343796/Shows#How-to-favorite-a-Show)

This feature is useful in a case where you are working on a show and do not want it be visible to anyone yet. Toggle the Private button so that it displays ON to make your show private.  The Private setting affects all child assets of the Show. For instance, if a public show is subsequently made private, all child assets will be private as well. You can confirm this by looking at the Platform setting for an individual video asset.

##  How to add notes
The Notes feature provides a place for editors to store internal notes and collaborate with colleagues. Notes is an optional feature intended as a convenience for console users and is not included in the API or displayed on frontend platforms. The text limit is 2,000 characters, including spaces, and can contain text only (hyperlinks can be added but they will not be clickable).
To use the Notes feature, simply click Notes at the top of the page and begin typing. The Notes bar displays in yellow when content has been added. If no notes are present, the bar displays in grey. When finished, click Save Notes to save your changes or Delete Notes to clear the entire field. The Notes feature contains its own save buttons that are separate of the object’s save buttons. So if you save the page but you don’t save the Notes section, your notes are not saved. 
Notes are read-only for the [viewer role](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343868/Roles+and+Permissions).

##  How to favorite a Show
Displaying only the shows that you frequently access can save a lot of time when you're working in the console. Use the Favorite feature to designate specific shows as Favorites and retrieve them more quickly. [Learn more about this feature](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5346954/How+to+Favorite+Shows)
##  Core Data
Adding as much Core data as possible is very important when it comes to the discovery of your video. The more details you add about your video, the easier viewers will be able to find it online.
Editors may modify specific show fields, as follows:
  * In the Short Description textbox, type a short description containing no more than 100 characters, including spaces (Figure 1.1). This appears in search results when a user searches for your show.
  * In the Long Description textbox, type a long description containing no more than 400 characters, including spaces (Figure 1.2). This appears on your video asset page and should providers viewers with a little more information about your show.
  * Click the Genre dropdown menu and click the genre with which your show should be associated (Figure 1.3).

![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343796/show-core-data1.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1631650673990&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
  * Click the Descending Episode Order toggle to arrange the order in which your episodes display (Figure 2.1).

![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343796/featured-preview4.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1639006827359&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
  * Once the code is pasted, the asset details surface immediately (Figure 5). If the asset needs to be modified, open the asset and make the changes.
    * Data includes the asset title, the franchise to which the asset belongs, the show title, the asset's location in Media Manager, the asset's availability and object type, and whether or not the asset is published. Do not use an unpublished asset. 
  * Save the page.

![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343796/featured-preview5.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1639006985835&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
  * After you've saved the page, go back to the asset and the Featured Preview assignment displays in the asset's breadcrumbs at the top of the page (Figure 6).


Figure 6
![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343796/featured-preview6.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1639055073839&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
The Featured Preview Content ID displays as the preview video that automatically plays at the top of the Show page on [PBS.org](http://pbs.org/). Use an asset that is representative of your show and would make users want to view more. 
This feature is intended for use with previews, not full length assets or clips.
Important notes:
  * This field is optional and is empty by default. 
  * If the Featured Preview Content ID field is left blank, the show's Background image from Media Manager displays. If the show does not have a Background image, the mezzanine 16:9 image of the full-length asset that the [Watch Now](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/584417283/How+to+Create+an+Official+Show+Preview#Program-the--Watch-Now--button)[ button](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/584417283/How+to+Create+an+Official+Show+Preview#Program-the--Watch-Now--button) goes to is used (following the show's ascending/descending logic)
  * The video asset must belong to the same show. You cannot add the PBS Content ID (CID) from an asset that belongs to a different show.
  * It is recommended that you use a preview, not a full length asset or clip.
  * Select a video that is less than 3 minutes long to avoid a pre-roll ad appearing. If you need an exception to this guideline, please [submit a support ticket](https://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new).
  * Do not use unpublished assets. An unpublished asset will not display and the fallback logic (explained in the second bullet point above) will be activated. 
  * Your Featured Preview selection can be changed or removed at any time.


The following image illustrates how a user on PBS.org accesses the asset you've add to the Featured Preview Content ID field.
The asset automatically plays on the right hand side when the user opens the show page.

##  Availability
Assets associated with this show can have their own unique availability settings designated at the [asset level](https://docs.pbs.org/display/MM/Assets). Individual assets can only be made more restrictive, not less restrictive.
###  Privacy and Platform Management
The Privacy and Platform management section provides the option to make your show visible to or hidden from selected platforms. 
Use Private toggle to hide the show from all platforms immediately or use the Make Private in Future field to set a future date for the show to become private. This is an optional feature that can be activated and deactivated at any time. 
####  How to schedule privacy and platforms
  * Click the toggle next to Private to immediately hide your show and prevent it from displaying on selected platforms (Figure 1.1). 
    * When the toggle displays ON, the show and all its child pages are not visible on platforms. 
    * When the toggle displays OFF, the show is visible on all assigned platforms. Keep in mind that some assets may have [custom platform settings](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343793/Assets#Platform-Management). 
  * To schedule your show to become private on a specific date in the future, click the Make Private in Future textbox and select a date on the calendar (Figure 1.2). The show becomes privateat 12:01am ET on the scheduled day.
  * The Platforms section displays the platforms on which your show may be viewed (Figure 1.3). Platforms are assigned by PBS and can be requested by [submitting a support ticket](https://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new).


Figure 1
![private-schedule1.jpg](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343796/private-schedule1.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1761670656403&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
  * When finished, scroll to the bottom of the page and click Save (Figure 2).


Figure 2
![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343796/privacy-save.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1655142453884&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
Once you’ve assigned a Make Private in Future date and saved the page, the date displays and Private toggle remains in the OFF position (Figure 3). Once the assigned date arrives, the toggle will switch to ON at 12:01am and the show is removed from displaying on any platforms. 
You can change the Private status at any time, however, you must [contact the Support team](https://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new) to modify the Platforms.

###  Geo and Passport Availability
The Availability tab regulates how content is available to viewers. Access to videos is controlled by a viewer's Passport status ([learn more about Passport](https://docs.pbs.org/space/PLUS/5505086)) and their geo location. 
User type | Definition  
---|---  
User type | Definition  
---|---  
Public | Users who are not Passport members (general public), or are not logged in.  
All Passport Members | All Passport members across all stations.  
Your Station's Passport Members |  Passport members belonging to one or more stations. Station assignment is determined in [Audience section of the Core Data tab](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343796/Shows#Core-Data) in a show. [Please contact PBS to modify the Audience field](http://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new) You can vary programming windows depending on the User Type. This user type only displays for station programs; national programs have no station component.  
Geo Availability | Definition  
Countries | The countries in which the video can be viewed.  
General Availability  | Definition  
Not Available | Never allowed to view the video.  
Always Available | Always allowed to view the video.  
Custom Time Frame | Allowed to view the video for a specific time frame.  
  * Content types are broken into three sections (full length, previews, clips) and are specified at the top of each section (Figure 1.1). You can assign viewing permissions for each type of content.
  * Viewer types are listed on the left side of the page (Figure 1.2). 
  * Click the Geo Availability dropdown menu to assign the countries in which the video content for the show should be available (Figure 1.3). All assets that are part of this show inherit the geo restrictions that are assigned here. You can assign different geo restrictions to each individual asset at the [asset level](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343793/Assets). Individual assets can only be made more restrictive, not less restrictive.
  * Click the General Availability dropdown menu next to the user type whose availability rules you want to modify (Figure 1.4).
  * The Duration option shows only for viewers who have been assigned a Custom Time Frame. Click the Duration dropdown menu to assign a timeframe for which the assignment is valid (Figure 1.5). You can assign by days, weeks, months, and years.


An important note about assignments
User types are listed in descending order from basic to advanced permissions. You cannot grant a "lesser" role more permissions than an advanced role. Each user type and permissions can only increase over the role above it. For instance, you cannot assign "Always Available" to Public users and assign "Not Available" to Passport users.

##  Relationships
The Producers and Distributors sections provide a place to keep track of all producers and distributors that are or have been associated with your show. This information is not mandatory and is mainly for your own record keeping. It will not appear in the [Media Manager API](https://docs.pbs.org/space/CDA/3047426/Media+Manager+API).
  * Click the Title dropdown menu and click the title of the producer or distributor (Figure 1.1).
  * In the Start Year and End Year textboxes, type the years that are applicable to this entry (Figure 1.2).
  * If you need to delete an entry, click the trashcan icon next to the entry you want to remove (Figure 1.3).
  * To add additional rows, click the blue Add Producer or Add Distributor button (Figure 1.4). If you need additional titles, please [submit a support ticket](http://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new) and list the titles you need.
