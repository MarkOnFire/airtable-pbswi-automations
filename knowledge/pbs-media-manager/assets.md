##  Overview
An asset is a video file that can be contained within a [Franchise](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343789), [Show](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343796), [Season](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343800), [Special](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343806), and [Episode](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343798). Assets can be full length episodes, clips, or previews. Because video clips and previews (not full length episodes) can be considered "Extras" in their own section on PBS.org, Media Manager provides the ability to create Assets and [Extras](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5344064) in two separate places in the console.
Episodes and Specials can contain only one full length episode but may include unlimited clips and previews. Once you have added a full length episode, you cannot add another to the same object. 
Media Manager optimizes the raw video file that you add to your asset and automatically generates several formats to adapt to a user's internet speed. So if a user with a slow internet connection clicks on your video, they are automatically served the file size that accommodates their internet connection speed. 
The following table illustrates the relationship between objects and asset types. It shows which objects accept specific asset types.

###  How to add notes
The Notes feature provides a place for editors to store internal notes and collaborate with colleagues. Notes is an optional feature intended as a convenience for console users and is not included in the API or displayed on frontend platforms. The text limit is 2,000 characters, including spaces, and can contain text only (hyperlinks can be added but they will not be clickable).
To use the Notes feature, simply click Notes at the top of the page and begin typing. The Notes bar displays in yellow when content has been added. If no notes are present, the bar displays in grey. When finished, click Save Notes to save your changes or Delete Notes to clear the entire field. The Notes feature contains its own save buttons that are separate of the object’s save buttons. So if you save the page but you don’t save the Notes section, your notes are not saved. 
Notes are read-only for the [viewer role](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343868/Roles+and+Permissions).

###  Create your asset
  * From an Episode or Special, click the Assets tab (Figure 1.1).
  * Click Create Asset located on the right side of the screen (Figure 1.2).


[Learn how to access Extras](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5344064)

  * Click the Object type dropdown menu and select Full Episode, Preview, or Clip (Figure 2). 


If Full Episode is not available, the object probably already contains a full episode.
Figure 2
![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343793/how-to-create-a-video-asset2.jpg?version=3&modificationDate=1506951555842&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
  * The selected object type displays (Figure 3.1).
  * In the Title textbox, type the title of your video asset containing no more than 120 characters, including spaces(Figure 3.2).
  * The slug is automatically created for you based on the title (Figure 3.3). 
  * Click Save (Figure 3.4).


If you receive an error message (500) when saving your file, check the Title field to be sure your character count has not surpassed 120 characters. If you have copied and pasted your title from another source such as Microsoft Word, some special characters, such as apostrophes, quotes, and commas may count as multiple character spaces and put your title over 120 characters. Try manually typing your title into the Title textbox.

  * A message confirming that your asset has saved appears in a green bar at the top of the page (Figure 4.1).
  * A persistent status bar appears at the top of the page and provides a quick view of the asset's status, including its published status, availability, and completion of required fields (Figure 4.2). Now you can begin filling out the rest of the metadata and add your video and caption files.

###  Core Data
  * If the asset contains a full length episode, the Title, Object type, Short and Long Descriptions are all carried over from the previous screen (Figure 1.1). Previews and Clips do not inherit the descriptions of the episode and must be added at the asset level.
    * The Object type can be modified at the asset level, however, the Short and Long Descriptions are pulled from the Episode page and must be modified at the episode level (Figure 1.2). Short Description has a limit of 100 characters, including spaces. Long Description has a limit of 400 characters, including spaces. You cannot change the short and long descriptions of a full episode, only clips and previews. You must go back to the [episode page](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343798) and change the descriptions there.
  * Click the Premiere and Encore Date textboxes to modify the dates (Figure 1.3).
    * Premiere date is the original online or on-air date of the video.

####  Alternate Accessibility Versions
In the Media Manager console, you can relate multiple, separate instances of the same video content, each with different enhanced accessibility features and different source video files. This helps users on pbs.org easily navigate between the related versions within the video player. (A ![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343793/Screen%20Shot%202023-10-13%20at%201.57.20%20PM.png?version=2&modificationDate=1697219919303&cacheVersion=1&api=v2) icon displays in the player control area, when one or more enhanced accessibility versions are available for a video.) 
What is Enhanced Accessibility?  
An accessibility option which is unique to a particular video, and/or may result in a unique video duration. The Enhanced Accessibility options in Media Manager include:
  * American Sign Language (ASL): A visual language, where information is conveyed using shape, placement, and movement of the hands, as well as facial expressions and body movements.
  * Extended Audio Description (EAD): With standard Audio Description (AD), descriptions fit within the existing, natural pauses in the video. With Extended Audio Description (EAD), longer pauses are added within the video, to provide opportunities for lengthier descriptions and more context. EAD videos are typically longer in duration.
  * Open Captions (OC): Captions which are burned into the video file and are always displayed during playback. Open Captions cannot be customized or turned off by the user.
    * NOTE: To comply with FCC caption requirements, a video with Open Captions can be provided as an alternate version, as long as there is another version available which has standard, customizable, and properly position captions. 


Why do videos with Enhanced Accessibility need to be separate versions (i.e. separate Media Manager video assets)?  
Each version typically has a unique source video file, which can vary based on the content and duration. A Media Manager video asset can only accept one video file.
Standard accessibility options can be managed within a single Media Manager asset because there is a single source video file, with a single duration. Standard options include: Multiple caption files for different languages, and multiple audio tracks for AD and different languages .
Example use case for relating enhanced accessibility videos
Say you have four (4) separate Media Manager video assets which all represent the same content, but the video duration and enhanced accessibility feature for each one is different:
  1. One instance has no enhanced accessibility options and the duration is 45 min. (It would have at least some of the standard accessibility options/requirements, such as one or more caption files, and one or more audio tracks included in the video file.)
  2. One instance has EAD (Extended Audio Description) and the duration is 60 min. (It's longer because extra pauses are added to provide more opportunities for audio description.)
  3. One instance has ASL (American Sign Language) and the duration is 45 min. (Its duration is the same as #1 but the video is presented with sign language, so it's a different video file.)
  4. One instance has OC (Open Captions) and its duration the 45 min. (The duration is the same as #1 but the video has burned-in captions which cannot be removed or customized. Open Captions may be preferred for some users, but they do not satisfy the FCC's caption requirements for standard, customizable, and properly positioned captions. The Open Caption video instance could only be provided as an alternate version.


How to relate videos with Enhanced Accessibility features
  1. Go to the Related Content tab for one of the videos. This is the (only) video where you will manage the relationships. For the example above, it's recommended to start in the non-enhanced version (#1), but it's not a requirement.
  2. Scroll down to the “Alternate Accessibility Versions” section.
  3. Add one related video at a time, entering its asset CID, and selecting the accessibility type.
     * The accessibility type for the initial video must also be selected.


How to tell if a video on pbs.org has enhanced accessibility versions
On pbs.org, when one or more enhanced accessibility versions are available for a video, a ![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343793/Screen%20Shot%202023-10-13%20at%201.57.20%20PM.png?version=2&modificationDate=1697219919303&cacheVersion=1&api=v2) icon displays in the player control area.
###  Availability
Availability determines the access viewers have to your video and the platforms on which your video is available.
####  Passport availability
Use the Passport Availability section to assign what type of users can access your content and the geo location of those users who should have access. Can all users access your content from anywhere in the world or should only those with a Passport membership have access? [Learn more about Passport](https://docs.pbs.org/space/PLUS/5505086/Passport) (This link takes you to the MVault documentation).
User types and permissions are defined as follows:
User type | Definition  
---|---  
User type | Definition  
---|---  
Public | Users who are not Passport members (general public), or are not logged in.  
All Passport Members | All Passport members across all stations.  
Your Station's Passport Members |  Passport members belonging to one or more stations. Station assignment is determined in [Audience section of the Core Data tab](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343796/Shows#Core-Data) in a show. [Please contact PBS to modify the Audience field](http://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new) You can vary programming windows depending on the User Type. This user type only displays for station programs; national programs have no station component.  
Geo Availability | Definition  
Countries |  The countries in which the asset is available for viewing. All assets inherit geo restrictions that are assigned at the show level. Individual assets can only be made more restrictive, not less restrictive. For instance, if restrictions at the show level are set to US and Canada, you cannot set your asset's restrictions to include US, Canada, and Mexico.  
General Availability  | Definition  
Not Available | Never allowed to view the video.  
Always Available | Always allowed to view the video.  
Custom Time Frame | Allowed to view the video for a specific time frame.  
User types are listed in descending order from basic to advanced permissions. You cannot grant a "lesser" role more permissions than an advanced role. Each user type and permissions can only increase over the role above it. For instance, you cannot make an asset available to everyone (Public) but restrict it from Passport members.
###  How to assign availability
  * Click the Availability tab (Figure 1).
  * Availability settings for Public users are listed first. Click the calendar icon on the right side to set the availability status or assign a custom time frame (Figure 1.1). 
##### Click here to learn more about the calendar
    * On the right side of the calendar, click one of the following options (1): 
      * Not Available - never allow this type of user to see the video, 
      * Always Available - allow the user to always view the video 
      * Custom Time Frame - assign customized dates and times. 
![:info:](https://pf-emoji-service--cdn.us-east-1.prod.public.atl-paas.net/atlassian/info_64.png)
The example below illustrates applying Custom Time Frames.
    * When the two calendars appear, click the day you want the video to become available on the calendar on the left (2) and on the calendar on the right, the day you want the video to become unavailable (3). 
    * The corresponding time, in hours and minutes, is beneath each calendar (4). Click each dropdown menu to assign a beginning time and ending time. All times are Eastern Standard Time (EST).
    * When finished, your assignments appear in the FROM and TO textboxes (5).
    * When finished, click Apply (6).

###  Notes on Availability
When viewing your list of Assets and Extras, the Availability column displays green checkmarks and red x's. These serve as a quick way of determining the availability assigned to a specific asset or extra. The order of the icons, from left to right, is as follows:
  * Public users
  * All Passport members
  * Your Station's Passport members


So in the following example, the Dublin Castle asset is not available to public users and all Passport members, however, your Station's Passport members can see the asset.
![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343793/asset-availability.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1483727513144&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
###  Platform Management
The Platform Management section allows you to choose the platforms on which you want your asset to be available. If no platforms are selected, your asset will not appear anywhere and can only be accessed by the direct URL to the object.
  * To search for a specific platform, type the platform name in the textbox provided (Figure 1.1) or click each individualplatform (Figure 1.2).
  * Click Add All to select all platforms (Figure 1.3).
  * Each time you click a platform, it automatically moves to the selectbox on the right, indicating it has been selected (Figure 1.4). 
  * To remove all platforms, click Remove All (Figure 1.5). To remove a single platform, click the platform name and it will move back to the box on the left side.

###  Note about PBS temporary S3 storage
If neither of the upload options listed above works for you, many stations and producers use the direct file upload method to ingest video and caption files in Media Manager, or have a hosting service to generate upload URLs (as shown below). While these methods are preferred, PBS offers a temporary S3 hosting solution, if necessary.
The PBS S3 ingest bucket should only be used to generate temporary URLs for video and caption file ingestion in Media Manager, and should not be used for other purposes, or for long-term storage.
Files in the PBS S3 ingest buckets that are older than 30 days will be removed automatically. As a reminder, files successfully ingested in Media Manager are stored in a separate archive bucket, so the 30-day clean-up for source files in the ingest bucket does not affect availability. In other words, the ingest bucket is only used for the source file ingestion process.
Please [contact PBS Support](https://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new) with questions or access requests.
How to add caption files
Accepted file formats: DFXP, SMPTE-TT, and SCC. [View more about closed captioning](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5344210/Closed+Captioning)
The FCC requires that you have a closed captioning file in the same language as your video's primary audio track language. If the caption file language does not match the primary language of the video file, you cannot publish your asset (unless a valid caption justification is provided). 
Example: If the primary language of your video is English, your caption file must be in English. If your video is in Spanish, your caption file must be in Spanish. 
[Learn more about adding multiple captions](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343793/Assets#Assets-multiplecaptions)
  1. Select your caption language from the select box.
  2. Add your caption files in one of the following ways: 


Add the full URL | Choose a file from your computer  
---|---  
Add the full URL | Choose a file from your computer

(click image to enlarge) ![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343793/add-video-file1.1.png?version=2&modificationDate=1671224074806&cacheVersion=1&api=v2) |  (click image to enlarge) ![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343793/add-video-file1.2.png?version=2&modificationDate=1671224105169&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)  
  * If a caption file is required (for publishing) and you have a valid (per FCC) justification for why it's not provided, click the checkbox next to Or, provide valid caption justification (Figure 2.1).
  * Click the radio button next to the justification that applies to your video (Figure 2.2). If none of the listed options fits your needs, click Other and in the textbox provided, manually type the reason for not ingesting a caption file.

Caption offset correction feature
This feature targets a particular scenario which results in a failed caption ingestion. This pertains to uploaded SCC caption files which are invalid due to a start time that is advanced by one hour. (Meaning the captioning and video/audio timing would be mis-aligned by one hour.) 
This timing is common (and valid) for SCC caption files used for broadcast, but it needs to be corrected (time shifted back by one hour) before getting uploaded in MM, for streaming.
How it works: If an SCC caption file is uploaded in the console which has the (invalid) one-hour advanced start time, an error message will display and present the user with an option to allow MM to programmatically correct the caption timing (shift it back one hour), and re-ingest the file. (Alternatively, the user can choose to correct the file themselves and re-upload it at a later time.)
If the user elects to proceed with the process, the caption file archived on S3 will be the corrected version. This is done so that if the user chooses to reingest the file again at a later time, the corrected one will be used without error.
This feature is available in the MM console, but not in the API.
![:warning:](https://pf-emoji-service--cdn.us-east-1.prod.public.atl-paas.net/atlassian/warning_64.png)
Important: If the user chooses to proceed with the automatic offset correction feature, it’s imperative that they subsequently verify the audio and closed captioning are accurately synced throughout the video, after ingestion is complete. Media Manager cannot verify synchronization, so this step must be completed to discharge our legal due diligence responsibility.
Saving your video and captions
  * Now that you have uploaded your video and closed captioning files, click Save to save the page (Figure 3.1).
    * To auto-publish your video file, click the Auto publish checkbox to the left of the Save button (Figure 3.2). When toggle is set to ON, your asset will publish automatically when all files have successfully ingested. See below to learn more about the auto-publish feature.


##### Learn more about auto-publish
####  What is auto-publish?
The auto-publish feature ensures that once all necessary files have been successfully ingested, your asset will automatically publish. This means that you can upload your video file (and caption file if applicable) and walk away during the ingestion process to do other things. You must check back in on the process in case any errors occur during ingestion. If errors occur, the process will stop and your asset will not publish until the errors are corrected.
####  What if I leave and my asset encounters an error?
It's very important to remember that when you are using the auto-publish feature, you mustbe diligent about checking the ingestion status. If ingestion fails, an error message appears in the console and your asset does not publish. You need to manually fix the errors and republish the asset by clicking the Publish button. Refer to the publish status to see if everything successfully ingested and published.

How to add multiple caption files
Because the FCC requires that you have a closed captioning file in the same primary language as your video's audio, you may need to upload more than one caption file. [Click here to learn how to change your video's primary audio](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343793/Assets#Assets-changeaudio)
This section shows you how to ingest additional caption files.
  * Beneath your existing caption file, click Add Caption (Figure 1).


Your existing, or primary, caption file must match the primary audio of your video file.
Figure 1
![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343793/multiple-caption1.png?version=1&modificationDate=1660924506066&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
  * The additional language option (in this example, Spanish) displays in the textbox at the top of the Add Closed Captioning section (Figure 2.1).
  * When more languages are added to Media Manager, click the downward-facing arrow on the right side of the textbox to display all additional language (Figure 2.2).
  * When finished, click Save to ingest the caption file (Figure 2.3).

Transcript files are automatically generated using ingested (or reingested) caption files. For each language provided in the caption files, a corresponding transcript file is generated in the same language.
In the console, the transcript URL/s are provided (when available) in the caption details area.
Important notes about transcript files:
  1. For the initial release, transcripts will only be generated for new caption ingests (or reingests) going forward. In the near future, we plan to generate transcript files for a subset of existing videos in the back catalog.
  2. Clients using the transcript files are responsible for making any necessary encoding conversion changes to accommodate special characters, such as those found in some non-English caption and transcript files. (This is already the case with our output VTT caption files.)
  3. Transcript files do not contain timestamps.


How to change the primary audio of your video
For videos that were added to Media Manager after April 2021, you can change the video's primary audio language using the following steps. For videos ingested before April 2021, please [submit a support ticket](https://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new) if you need the primary language changed.
  * After your video has been ingested, click the information icon (Figure 1).

    * Trick Play - files generated to surface preview thumbnail images when users scrub forward/backward within a video. For now, the files generated are supported by Roku only, however, you can see the trick play feature in your [video preview](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343793/Assets#Preview).[Learn more about trick play on Roku](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/media-playback/trick-mode.md)
      * Notes about Trick Play files: Only assets that have been created (or have had their video files re-ingested) since February 13, 2020 have trick play files generated. Trick play output files are generated and displayed in the console after video ingestion has fully completed. Older videos display a "No output files yet!" message in the Trick Play section of the output files. PBS is working to generate trick play files for older content. 


If there are no output files after a minute or so, refresh the page.

How to replace video and closed captioning files
Live replace is a feature that enables you to replace a video and/or caption file without disrupting the viewing experience. While the file replace is in progress, viewers continue to access the video and captions that are currently live and can do so until the their cache has cleared or they begin a new session. For users who keep the original video screen open, or have paused playback for a period of time, the original file remains available for up to a day after the replacement is complete. 
  * To begin replacing your files, click the pencil icon to surface the fields where you can add a new file (Figure 1). 


Figure 1
![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343793/livereplace1.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1601574452627&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
  * Add the file URL in the textbox or click Choose to select a file from your computer (Figure 2.1).
  * Click Save (Figure 2.2).


You can replace video and caption files simultaneously. 
Figure 2
![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343793/livereplace2.jpg?version=3&modificationDate=1603930567785&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
  * While the file replace is in progress, information for both the original and new files displays. When the new file has fully ingested, a message indicating so displays at the top of the page (Figure 3.1) and Ingestion Complete displays to the right of the new file name (Figure 3.2). Click the information icon (![information-icon.jpg](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343793/information-icon.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1601569012232&cacheVersion=1&api=v2) ) to view file details.
  * Refresh the page to remove the old file from view so that only details for the new file display (Figure 3.3).


If a replaced file fails ingestion for any reason, you will be prompted to cancel the replace (returning to the original file), or re-try the ingestion. 
  * Click Cancel to cancel the entire operation
  * Click Try Again to try adding a new file again

###  Support for Audio Description and Secondary Languages
Media Manager supports video source files which include oneor more audio tracks. ([See Full Specs](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343887/Video+%26+Audio+Specs).)
For example, the video source file may have English as the primary audio track, and there could be additional tracks included for English Audio Description (AD), and other languages such as Spanish, French, etc.
What is Audio Description (AD): Additional audio content, inserted as a narrative between the dialogue and other program sounds, which describes visual aspects of the video that may not be accessible to some visually-impaired users. Audio Description is provided as a separate track, and users can choose to turn it on in addition to the primary audio track.
At this time, not all PBS platform players can support audio track selection, but this will be improved over time. [See Full Specs](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343887/Video+%26+Audio+Specs) to get more information about player support.)
Detected audio details are displayed for videos ingested on/after April 12, 2021 (when the support for multiple audio tracks was introduced). This can be found in the expandable Details area for the video file on an asset's Video tab.
  * Note: For videos ingested prior to the feature release, the audio details will not be displayed in the console. In the future, we will determine how to handle populating the audio details for pre-existing video files. Stay tuned.


At this time, Media Manager only supports uploading a single closed captioning file, regardless of the number of audio tracks.
Get the [Full Specs](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343887/Video+%26+Audio+Specs) and learn more about uploading video files containing multiple audio tracks.
###  Images
The image section of the console is where the image that represents your video across PBS platforms and serves as the video player placeholder is assigned. 
####  Image guidelines
DO NOT USE the "Asset Original" image profile. This is a deprecated profile and is not used on any PBS platforms. It will be removed in the future.
  * Media Manager requires (for publishing) the ingestion of one "Mezzanine 16x9" image file per asset, if the corresponding video file is also 16x9.
  * The .jpg image format/extension is strongly recommended, as it will be size-optimized for streaming.
  * A mezzanine image is defined as an image with a 16:9 ratio. Common pixel dimensions include: 1920x1080, 1280x720
  * Only one image profile per asset is allowed. 


Although other image profiles are available in the console, the Mezzanine 16x9 is typically the only profile used. The following table displays each available image profile and where it should or should not be used. 
Image Profile | Used for  
---|---  
Image Profile | Used for  
---|---  
GA Mezzanine 16x9 | GA videos (local and national)  
Kids Mezzanine 16x9 | KIDS videos  
GA Mezzanine 4x3 | Use only if corresponding video is 4x3  
Kids Mezzanine 4x3 | Use only if corresponding video is 4x3  
Asset Original | Do not use   
####  How to add your image file

###  Chapters 
####  What are chapters?
Chapters are short descriptions of individual segments throughout the duration of a video. When a user hovers the mouse over the tickmarks aligned along the chapter timeline at the bottom of the video screen, the title of each chapter appears, giving the user an idea of what is included in each particular short segment, or chapter. These chapter titles help the viewer track the progression of the video and enable them to skip to a particular chapter of interest by clicking a tickmark.

##  Extras
An Extra is a type of Video Asset that can be associated with a [Franchise](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343789), [Show](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343796), or [Season](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343800). Extras can be Clips or Previews only (no Full Length Episodes) and have no associated ads. These assets appear on [PBS.org](http://pbs.org/) by scrolling down a show page to the Clips and Previews or Extras sections. After you have clicked the Extras tab, the steps for creating a preview or clip exactly mirror the steps involved when creating a preview or clip from the Assets tab. 
Want to use your asset as the preview for your show on PBS.org? [Click here to learn how](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343796/Shows#Featured-Preview-Content-ID)

##  How to reingest a video file 
In some cases where, for example, an older video is lacking some of the modern output encodings, or if an output encoding fails to get generated during the initial transcode process, you can reingest the existing video file. Only video files that have an associated archive file available at its S3 location can be reingested. If the archived video file is glacierized in S3, the reingestion process takes about 5-12 hours to complete. The process is automated and video playback is not disrupted during the reingestion process.
Reingesting a video file is not intended for general troubleshooting or for bulk tasks. Please check the following before reingesting a file:

The steps below illustrate how to reingest a video file in Media Manager.
##### What does glacierize mean?
When a video is glacierized, it goes into an Amazon “Glacier” storage service that is optimized for infrequently used data, or "cold data." This allows us to store archived video files at a reduced cost, and only request access to them as needed. Getting access to glacierized files can take up to 12 hours. All video archive files get stored in Amazon Glacier shortly after being ingested in Media Manager.
  * In the Media Manager console, go to the episode of the show that holds the video file you want to reingest and click the Video tab (Figure 1.1).
  * In the Video section, under the Actions column on the right side of the page, click the orange circular left-facing arrow (Figure 1.2).

  * Once the video has completed ingestion, an Ingestion Complete confirmation label displays (Figure 4.1).
  * Another confirmation indicating that the file has been reingested displays in a green bar and you are instructed to refresh your browser to update the page (Figure 4.2).

##  How to reingest a caption file 
Reingesting your caption file can be useful as a troubleshooting step. An example of this is, for instance, if you've uploaded video and caption files, but the captions are not displaying in the player. Use the caption reingest feature to see if it fixes the issue. 
After the reingest has completed, we recommend testing in the [preview player](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343793/Assets#Preview). This is the fastest method and it can be done right in the console.

  * After ingestion is complete, the original caption file has been removed (Figure 4.1).
  * The newly ingested file displays an Ingestion Complete label (Figure 4.2).
  * An alert displays, indicating that the file has successfully completed and you should refresh the page to update your console's display (Figure 4.3).
