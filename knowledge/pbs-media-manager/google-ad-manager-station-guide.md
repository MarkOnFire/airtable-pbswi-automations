##  Overview
The Google Ad Manager Station Guide illustrates how to add your inventory to Google Ad Manager. Google Ad Manager is an advertisement software as a service application run by Google and is available to local station videos only. [Learn more](https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/solutions/revenue-management/#error=no_adsense)
The examples below demonstrate only the basic fields that need to be filled out. You can of course add more information but this page shows you how to add just the basics. 
Sponsorship messaging can be added [at the show level](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343796/Shows) and can be controlled under the Additional Data tab [at the asset level](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343793/Assets#Additional-Data). Metadata entered into the platform is passed to the ad server in the form of tags that can be targeted. 
Pre-roll is available on desktop, mobile web, iOS and Android mobile apps, Roku, Apple TV, Fire TV and Android TV.

##  How to add your inventory
If you do not yet have access to Google Ad Manager, please [fill out this form](http://bit.ly/DFPforPBS) and we’ll add you to the system.
  * Once you've been added to the system, log in to [https://admanager.google.com/home/](https://admanager.google.com/home/) with the user info you received from Google. 
  * If you have access to multiple accounts for Google Ad Manager, select Public Broadcasting Service 22540141786.

  * Click the Advertiser dropdown menu and begin typing the name of the advertiser you want. If there are no advertisers that match your criteria, click Add a new company (Figure 2).


If you are using Google Ad Manager for the first time there will be no companies listed.
Figure 2
![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5344208/2-edit.png?version=2&modificationDate=1582741750043&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)

  * In the Teams section, begin typing the name of the team. When the list appears, click the checkbox next to the one you want (Figure 3.4).
  * When finished, click Save (Figure 3.5).

  * In the Expected Creatives section, under creative size, insert 400x300v (Figure 7).


The creative size for video should always be 400x300v. This size is a placeholder and is not indicative of the video size that is displayed live. When you upload your assets as a 400x300v, Google Ad Manager will automatically transcode the assets into a variety of file types and sizes. Google Ad Manager will then serve the appropriate version according to the user’s bandwidth/connection and device.
