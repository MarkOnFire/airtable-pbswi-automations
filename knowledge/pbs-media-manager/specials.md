##  Overview
A special is a one-time-only (OTO), which does not live within a season structure. A special object is used for two different use cases:
  1. A stand-alone movie, which contains a single, full length video. In this case, there will be a a show object and full length video within a special object, both with the same title.
    1. Example: "American Pharaoh"
    2. Example: "ABBA Forever: A Celebration"
    3. Example: "American Creed"
  2. A one-off event or feature that is associated with a show but does not fall within any of the show's seasons. A show can have multiple specials.
    1. Example: Downton Abbey's "Behind the Drama", or America's Test Kitchen's "Home for the Holidays"
    2. Example: NOVA's "Electromagnetic Space", or NOVA's "Dolphin Mirror" (NOVA has many specials)


##  How Specials display on PBS.org
A Special is indicated by a label located near the top of the Special (Figure 1.1). Learn more about the Special or view other Episodes by using the menu beneath the video (Figure 1.2).

###  How to add notes
The Notes feature provides a place for editors to store internal notes and collaborate with colleagues. Notes is an optional feature intended as a convenience for console users and is not included in the API or displayed on frontend platforms. The text limit is 2,000 characters, including spaces, and can contain text only (hyperlinks can be added but they will not be clickable).
To use the Notes feature, simply click Notes at the top of the page and begin typing. The Notes bar displays in yellow when content has been added. If no notes are present, the bar displays in grey. When finished, click Save Notes to save your changes or Delete Notes to clear the entire field. The Notes feature contains its own save buttons that are separate of the object’s save buttons. So if you save the page but you don’t save the Notes section, your notes are not saved. 
Notes are read-only for the [viewer role](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343868/Roles+and+Permissions).
