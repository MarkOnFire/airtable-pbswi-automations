##  Overview
Episodes are created within a season and can contain any type of [video asset](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343793) (full episode, preview, or clip). If an episode does not belong to a season, it will be treated as a [Special](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343806). 
##  Where Episodes are located on [PBS.org](http://pbs.org/)

(3) TVSS Details: Displays the show details that are pulled from TVSS when a successful match has been made between the TMS ID and TVSS. ![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343798/tms-id-episode.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1559053546495&cacheVersion=1&api=v2) | No

###  How to add notes
The Notes feature provides a place for editors to store internal notes and collaborate with colleagues. Notes is an optional feature intended as a convenience for console users and is not included in the API or displayed on frontend platforms. The text limit is 2,000 characters, including spaces, and can contain text only (hyperlinks can be added but they will not be clickable).
To use the Notes feature, simply click Notes at the top of the page and begin typing. The Notes bar displays in yellow when content has been added. If no notes are present, the bar displays in grey. When finished, click Save Notes to save your changes or Delete Notes to clear the entire field. The Notes feature contains its own save buttons that are separate of the object’s save buttons. So if you save the page but you don’t save the Notes section, your notes are not saved. 
Notes are read-only for the [viewer role](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343868/Roles+and+Permissions).

###  Create your episode
If you are working within a season that has already been created, follow the steps below to create an episode within the season. If you have not yet created a season, [learn how to create a season](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343800/Seasons#How-to-create-a-season).
  * When you are on the Seasons tab, click the name of the Season to which you want to add the episode (Figure 1).

  * Click the Create Episode (Figure 2).

![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343798/create-episode2.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1651237997026&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
  * In the Title textbox, type a title for your episode containing no more than 120 characters, including spaces (Figure 3.1).
  * As you type the title of the Episode, the slug auto-populates (Figure 3.2).
  * Episodes use ordinal numbers to identify each episode's position in the season and are automatically labeled "1" for the first episode, "2" for the second episode, and so on. If episodes already exist in this season, this field auto-populates with the next logical episode number. You may type an Episode number in the Episode Number textbox, if desired (Figure 3.3).
  * The Segment field is available as an identifier for multi-part episodes (Figure 3.4). This is rarely used and you do not need to worry about this field.
  * In the Short Description textbox, type a short description containing no more than 100 characters, including spaces (Figure 3.5).
  * In the Long Description textbox, type a long description containing no more than 400 characters, including spaces (Figure 3.6). 
![:info:](https://pf-emoji-service--cdn.us-east-1.prod.public.atl-paas.net/atlassian/info_64.png)
These fields accept HTML (example code: <a href="https://www.pbs.org">PBS</a>).
  * When finished, click Save (Figure 3.7).


If you receive an error message (500) when saving your file, check the Title field to be sure your character count has not surpassed 120 characters. If you have copied and pasted your title from another source such as Microsoft Word, some special characters, such as apostrophes, quotes, and commas may count as multiple character spaces and put your title over 120 characters. Try manually typing your title into the Title textbox.

  * PBS Content ID in a unique identifier that auto-populates and cannot be changed (Figure 4.1). 
  * The TMS ID is a unique ID that maps the episode to TVSS (Figure 4.2). This ID goes through several checks and often results in an empty field, however, you can manually add an ID, if necessary.
    * If a match is made, click TVSS Details to view TVSS description details (Figure 4.3).
  * Fill out the Episode NOLA if desired (Figure 4.4). This is not required.
  * The Premiere Date defaults to the date the episode was created. To modify the date, manually type the date into the textbox or click the calendar icon on the right side (Figure 4.5).
  * The Encore Date is the on-air rebroadcast date (Figure 4.6). It defaults to the same date as the Premiere Date but can be modified in the same way you would modify the Premiere Date.
  * Click Save (Figure 4.7).
