Some objects in Media Manager can be moved to different categories and reassigned to different content types. For instance, you can move an episode to a different season or you can make a special into an episode. 
The following objects can be edited:

  * [Episodes](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343798)
  * [Asset](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343793)
  * [Extras](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5344064)

##  How to convert an extra to a full length asset
Full length assets can only be included in episodes and specials, so when a full length asset is moved from a special to a season (or show) it must be classified as a clip or a preview. This section demonstrates how to convert an extra to a full length asset.
You must already have an existing special in which to place the asset. If the special does not exist, it needs to be created. [Create special](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343806/Specials#How-to-create-a-special) / [Create episode](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343798/Episodes#How-to-create-an-episode)
  * Open the season-level extra that you want to edit (Figure 1). 


Figure 1
![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343842/convert-extra-to-full-length1.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1495222746251&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
  * Click Edit Type/Location in the upper right corner (Figure 2).


Figure 2
![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343842/convert-extra-to-full-length2.jpg?version=2&modificationDate=1500580393053&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
  * Click the Season dropdown menu and select no season, represented by the “------“ (Figure 3.1).
  * Click the Episode dropdown menu and click the special to which the asset should belong (Figure 3.2).
  * Click the Asset Type dropdown menu and click Full Episode (Figure 3.3). Full Episode will not appear as an option if the special already contains a full length asset. You must remove the existing full length asset in the special before assigning this asset.
  * Click Save (Figure 3.4).
