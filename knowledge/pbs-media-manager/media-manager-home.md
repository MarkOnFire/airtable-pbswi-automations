##  Overview
Media Manager is a content management system (CMS) used by the PBS community to publish and distribute videos across platforms. It seeks to improve the way stations, producers, and users search and view digital content, and provides the ability to organize, relate, and present it in ways that streamline searchability.
What does all of that mean? Generally speaking, it means that searching for videos on PBS.org and station and producer sites is easier than ever. When your video is mapped properly in Media Manager, it's possible to locate it through more granular searches such as a particular show within a season or a specific episode within a show.
Your video content can be organized within the following categories:
  * [Franchises](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343789)
  * [Shows](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343796)
  * [Seasons](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343800)
  * [Episodes](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343798)
  * [Specials](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343806)
  * [Collections](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343803)
