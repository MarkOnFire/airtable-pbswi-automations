##  Overview
A season is a collection of episodes that are available within a certain time frame and comprise a segment of a show’s overall run. The following can be added to a Season:
  * [season](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343800/Seasons#How-to-create-a-season)
  * [episode](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343798)
  * [extra (preview or clip)](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5344064)


All assets associated with each season are visible right from the dashboard, as seen in the video below:
( Click the ![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343800/expand-video.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1488915539115&cacheVersion=1&api=v2) symbol in the bottom right corner of the video to enlarge )
##### Trouble viewing the video?
If you cannot see the entire video on your device, please collapse the left navigation menu by clicking the line that separates the grey left navigation menu and the white page content section.

##  Where Seasons display on [PBS.org](http://pbs.org/)
  * Seasons can be found on the Show page under the Episodes section (Figure 1.1).
  * Click the Season dropdown menu to display all seasons (Figure 1.2).

##  How to create a season
Field | Notes | Required for create?  
---|---|---  
Field | Notes | Required for create?  
---|---|---  
Season Number | A sequential number that must be unique per show (i.e.: you cannot have more than one of the same numbered season per show). | Y  
Title | Title of the season. No more than 256 characters, including spaces. | N  
PBS Content ID | Unique identifier that is auto-generated upon create. | N  
Short Description | 100 characters or less, including spaces. Used primarily when space is limited, such as on apps and small screens. | N  
Long Description | 400 characters or less, including spaces. | N  
###  How to add notes
The Notes feature provides a place for editors to store internal notes and collaborate with colleagues. Notes is an optional feature intended as a convenience for console users and is not included in the API or displayed on frontend platforms. The text limit is 2,000 characters, including spaces, and can contain text only (hyperlinks can be added but they will not be clickable).
To use the Notes feature, simply click Notes at the top of the page and begin typing. The Notes bar displays in yellow when content has been added. If no notes are present, the bar displays in grey. When finished, click Save Notes to save your changes or Delete Notes to clear the entire field. The Notes feature contains its own save buttons that are separate of the object’s save buttons. So if you save the page but you don’t save the Notes section, your notes are not saved. 
Notes are read-only for the [viewer role](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343868/Roles+and+Permissions).

###  Create your season
If no seasons currently exist for your show, you will encounter a message explaining that each season you add will follow the format, either ordinal (e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc.) or year-based (e.g. 2016, 2017, etc.), that was designated in the [Core Data tab of your show](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343796/Shows#Core-Data) when your show was created. Each season you add will follow the format that was initially assigned. [Contact PBS](http://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new) if the Ordinal Season field needs to be changed.
  * In the left side navigation menu, click Shows (Figure 1.1). 
  * Click the show to which you want to add a season (Figure 1.2).
  * Type keywords into the search textbox in the upper right side of the page to search for the show you want (Figure 1.3).
  * Click the Display records dropdown menu and select how many records you want to appear on the page at once (Figure 1.4).

Figure 2
![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343800/create-season2.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1618944491392&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
  * Type the season number in the textbox or, once you hover over or click inside the textbox, click the up and down arrows on the far right side of the selectbox to assign a season number (Figure 4.1). 
![:warning:](https://pf-emoji-service--cdn.us-east-1.prod.public.atl-paas.net/atlassian/warning_64.png)
If the Ordinal Season toggle is turned OFF in the Core Data tab of the Show, this will be presented in years (2015, 2016, etc.). To change this setting, you must [contact PBS](http://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new).
  * When finished, click Save (Figure 4.2).


Figure 3
![](https://docs.pbs.org/download/attachments/5343800/create-season3.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1618944544959&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
The season has been created and you can begin adding metadata.
###  Add Core Data
  * The season number displays and can be changed, if necessary (Figure 4.1).
  * In the Title textbox, type a title for your episode containing no more than 256 characters, including spaces (Figure 4.2).
  * The PBS Content ID is a unique identifier for your season and cannot be modified (Figure 4.3).
  * In the Short Description textbox, type a short description containing no more than 100 characters, including spaces (Figure 4.4).*
  * In the Long Description textbox, type a long description containing no more than 400 characters, including spaces (Figure 4.5).*


* Short and Long Description fields accept HTML (example code: <a href="[http://www.pbs.org">PBS</a](https://docs.pbs.org/space/MM/5343800/Seasons)>). These fields will only show up on over-the-top devices such as Roku and Apple TV. The Show description is used for seasons.
####  URLs & Social
Use this section to create social media links that are specific to your season. Example: [https://www.facebook.com/mercystreetpbs/](https://www.facebook.com/100044262077719/videos/3708047409436935)
  * Click the Type dropdown menu and click the type of social media site you want to target, and in the corresponding URL textbox, type the full URL of your season on the associated site (Figure 4.6). Do not use the Buy DVD field. This feature is no longer in use.
  * Click the blue Add More button to add additional rows (Figure 4.7).
  * The Created and Updated dates are automatically generated and cannot be modified (Figure 4.8). If you see Corebot on this line it simply means your season was ported from the old video manager called COVE to Media Manager and no action is required by you.
  * When finished, click Save (Figure 4.9).


If you need additional items added to the Type list, please [submit a support ticket](http://digitalsupport.pbs.org/support/tickets/new).

  * The image from the most recent full length asset is used.
  * If no full length asset is available, the image from the most recent preview asset is used.
  * If no previews are available, the image from the most recent clip is used.


How to manually add an image
  * Click the Image tab and under the Add New Image section, click Choose to select an image from your computer (Figure 1).
